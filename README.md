# Ketchup

Ketchup is a Pomodoro timer that uses your mobiles accelerometer to start/stop the timer. It was built in a day.

It is very simple to use.

1. Visit the [Live Demo](http://rohanlikhite.com/projects/ketchup) page via your mobile browser
2. Place your phone down to start the timer

###App States and UI/UX

Ketchup has 4 states. Start, Idle, Work, and Break. The user can navigate between each state by simply moving their device. Once a Pomodoro has been completed, the user is notified to take a break. After they're done, the user simply has to place their device down to begin the next 25 min session. 

The UI for the app is very straightforward and simple. Users are notified of background tasks via animated images, and are notified of state changes via the changing of background colours and text. 


###Conclusion

Overall this sprint was an amazing experience. Building something within 24 hours on my own was challenging and it taught me a lot about agile development. There are many things which I wish to add to Ketchup (audible alerts, more features, help), and will be doing so in the coming weeks.
